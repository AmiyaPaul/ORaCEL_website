                    <p>Wire-bar coating is quite similar with blade coating method. A wire-wound bar is a stainless steel rod around which stainless steel wire is tightly wrapped. Those wound wires create a thread which is always the same profile. Wire size is determined by the diameter of wire wrapped around the bar and it is a key parameter to determine the amount of coating solution by the open area. The eventual film coating thickness is dependent on bar height and deposition speed as well as solution concentration, viscosity and drying characteristics.

                    <p>Time and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) uniquely combines the power of ultrafast lasers and photoemission spectroscopy in order to directly probe the excited states and nonequilibrium dynamics of materials. A low energy ‘pump’ pulse first excites the electrons into an excited state, followed by a ‘probe’ pulse which ejects the electrons from the material for measurement. Delaying the pump pulse with respect to the probe allows us to see snap shots of the electrons as they decay back to the ground state. Our 2D CCD detector allows us to also view the momentum dependence of these states and the decay that follows. This technique gives us deep insight into the scattering mechanisms which takes place in materials, which helps us to understand the transport that takes place in devices.</p>

                    <p>A commercial probe station (<a href="http://www.janis.com/ProbeStations_Home_KeySupplier.aspx">Janis</a>) with 4 independent micrometers for positioning needle probes inside a turbo-pumped high vacuum chamber is employed to characterize charge transport in organic films. The electrical probes are coupled to triaxial feedthroughs on an electrically isolatable cold stage. Cooling is provided by a cryogen-free Gifford-McMahon refrigerator and allows access to temperatures as low as 5K using only gaseous He.</p>

                    <p>The pump beam at 1 KHz repetition rate (any wavelength from 270 nm to 3200 nm) is generated by a commercially available optical parametric amplifier pumped by a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier. Pulse laser excitation is then followed by a second broad band (350-1600 nm) generated in a CaF2 or sapphire or flint glass. A HELIOS transient absorption spectrometer is used for recording the dynamics of transient absorption spectra up to 6.8 ns with about 200 fs instrument response.</p>

                    <p>TR-SHG experiments are performed using a Ti- Sapphire laser (250 KHz, 800 nm) to study interface properties. The output of regenerative amplifier is split into two beams: one as probe (800 nm) and the other to generate a tunable pump beam (500–750 nm) via optical parametric amplification. In addition this setup is used to perform pump probe in transmission and reflection (especially for devices) geometry as well as transient absorption microscopy.</p>

                <div class="imgtext">
                    <p>This equipment system has the unique capability to control the temperature of a removable sample probe over a temperature range of T 1.8 K to T = 300 K with simultaneous control of a magnetic field. The variable field is controllable up to ±6.0 Tesla in the z-axis with a 1 Tesla spherical rotatable vector (at any degree). This equipment provides a unique platform for <strong>spin transport, spin Seebeck, spin transfer torque, photoluminescence, electroluminescence, and magneto-thermoelectrics in various magnetic materials and organic-based spintronic devices that we will be studying</strong>. The optical access in the magnet system enables us to perform the magneto-optical measurement as a function of magnetic field and temperature, providing a non-contact but sensitive approach for the magnetic characterization of the studied magnetic materials and organic spintronic devices that we will be studying.
The 2D FTS is performed using 1 KHz laser system unravel the electronic coupling between different resonances in the material. Dazzler pulse shaper is used in this experiment which can delay, filter, compress, split femtosecond pulses without losing coherence.</p>

                    <p>The Sagnac Interferometer is a high-resolution optical instrument consisting of a high-field sweepable superconducting magnet, cryogenic system to cool the sample, and assorted optical components. In contrast to the conventional magneto-optical set up of which sensitivity is limited around µradians, it is used to measure the ultra-small angular rotation (with resolution as fine as <strong>10 nano-radians</strong>) of linearly polarized light generated in various physical situations. Please see the figure 1 for the Sagnac Interferometer set up. <strong>Recently Sagnac Interferometer has been successfully applied to measure spin Seebeck effect in the ferromagnetic metal film</strong> (McLaughlin and Sun et al, <i>Phys. Rev. B: Rapid Communications</i> 95, 180401(R) (2017). ‘Editor’s suggestion’).</p>

                    <p>Ferromagnetic resonance is a spectroscopic technique that takes advantage of the coupling between an RF signal traveling in the coplanar waveguide, and the magnetization of a sample sitting on top of the waveguide (see Figure 4). This is a set of accessory inserts for the Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) facility that is located in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. The equipment consists of two main instruments, namely the PPMS ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) Stand-alone CryoFMR probe, PhaseFMR spectrometer (PFMR) as well as PPMS Permute Box that allows electrical detection from the FMR probe. Both, the use of the PFMR and the CryoFMR technique require the presence of strong, fast sweepable magnetic fields, highly sophisticated Keysight microwave sources with tunable frequency in the centimeter wavelength range (9kHz to 20 GHz) as well a complex electronics for the control and data collection.</p>
