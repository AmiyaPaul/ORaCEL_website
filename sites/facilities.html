                    <p>Wire-bar coating is quite similar with blade coating method. A wire-wound bar is a stainless steel rod around which stainless steel wire is tightly wrapped. Those wound wires create a thread which is always the same profile.

The eventual film coating thickness is dependent on bar height and deposition speed as well as solution concentration, viscosity and drying characteristics.

                    <p>Time and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) uniquely combines the power of ultrafast lasers and photoemission spectroscopy in order to directly probe the excited states and nonequilibrium dynamics of materials. A low energy ‘pump’ pulse first excites the electrons into an excited state, followed by a ‘probe’ pulse which ejects the electrons from the material for measurement. Delaying the pump pulse with respect to the probe allows us to see snap shots of the electrons as they decay back to the ground state. Our 2D CCD detector allows us to also view the momentum dependence of these states and the decay that follows. This technique gives us deep insight into the scattering mechanisms which takes place in materials, which helps us to understand the transport that takes place in devices.</p>

In contrast to the conventional magneto-optical set up of which sensitivity is limited around µradians, it is used to measure the ultra-small angular rotation (with resolution as fine as <strong>10 nano-radians</strong>) of linearly polarized light generated in various physical situations. Please see the figure 1 for the Sagnac Interferometer set up. <strong>Recently Sagnac Interferometer has been successfully applied to measure spin Seebeck effect in the ferromagnetic metal film</strong> (McLaughlin and Sun et al, <i>Phys.

                    <p>Ferromagnetic resonance is a spectroscopic technique that takes advantage of the coupling between an RF signal traveling in the coplanar waveguide, and the magnetization of a sample sitting on top of the waveguide (see Figure 4). This is a set of accessory inserts for the Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) facility that is located in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. The equipment consists of two main instruments, namely the PPMS ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) Stand-alone CryoFMR probe, PhaseFMR spectrometer (PFMR) as well as PPMS Permute Box that allows electrical detection from the FMR probe. Both, the use of the PFMR and the CryoFMR technique require the presence of strong, fast sweepable magnetic fields, highly sophisticated Keysight microwave sources with tunable frequency in the centimeter wavelength range (9kHz to 20 GHz) as well a complex electronics for the control and data collection.</p>
